This project aims to create a firmware for some PIC/ARM devices that support
USB transfers, the corresponding Userspace driver/library to interact with the
device and an example tool to read some information from the A/D module of the
device.

ad_tool/	folder contains the tool to use the A/D module of the device
arm/		folder contains the firmware for some ARM devices
driver/		folder contains the library/driver to use the USB stack in the device
pic/		folder contains the firmware for some PIC devices
